# Todonner
A simple to-do app made using React and Zustand.

Zustand is used here to store the state of the application in localStorage, allowing the todos to be persistent even if the browser is closed and the page is reopened.

This is a practice project with primary purpose of learning to use Zustand.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`
### `npm test`
### `npm run build`
